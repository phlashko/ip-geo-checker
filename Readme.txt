Thank you for taking interest in my GeoIP script.  I hope you find it useful.  

~~ Things to remember ~~
1. Make sure the pcap your pulling the ips from is in the same folder as the script
2. Make sure you give yourself execute permission on the script chmod 764 ip-geo-checker.sh
3. Run the script like this  "ip-geo-checker.sh nameofthefilefor.pcap
